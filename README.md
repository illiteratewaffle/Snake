## Gameplay
| Feature               | Status | Notes |
|-----------------------|:------:|-------|
| 20â€¯Ã—â€¯20 grid          | âœ…     | Fixed size for now |
| Single apple spawning | âœ…     | Spawns on any empty cell |
| Growing snake         | âœ…     | Length +1 per apple |
| Wall / self collision | âœ…     | Ends the game |
| Realâ€‘time input       |   ðŸš§   | Currently **lineâ€‘buffered** (press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each key) |

The board prints as rows of integers:  
`0 = empty`, `1 = snake`, `2 = apple`.

## Controls

a  â†’  move left

d  â†’  move right
```
